# Constraints

This is just me playing around with the JaCoP constraint solver. Includes an implementation of the "Einstein/Zebra" puzzle (as specified [here][einstein]). It got the same answer as someone nearby who solved it by hand so it must be right.

JaCoP is released under the AGPLv3 so this is too.
